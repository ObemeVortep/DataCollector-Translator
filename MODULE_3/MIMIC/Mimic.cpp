/*
 * This source file implements logic for conditionally launching external applications via low-level process APIs:
 * - Parses executable paths and command-line parameters from raw input, removing quotes and separating arguments.
 * - Validates launch conditions based on placeholder checks to prevent unnecessary execution.
 * - Delegates process creation to a low-level routine using dynamically supplied function pointers.
 * - Avoids standard shell execution mechanisms for tighter control and compatibility.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
