## üß© MODULE_3 ‚Äì Loader & Deployment Orchestrator

This module is the **central loader** that initializes and orchestrates long-term components of the system.  
Originally, all five modules were implemented inside this single executable.  
However, for better modularity and stealth, the project was split ‚Äî leaving this component to handle only the minimal core logic required to orchestrate long-term execution.

### üí° Responsibilities

- Launches the mimicked user-facing application to maintain continuity.
- Performs runtime environment validation and basic anti-analysis checks.
- Downloads and extracts two critical long-running components:
  - **MODULE_4** ‚Äì a monitoring utility to ensure continuity and restart-on-failure.
  - **MODULE_5** ‚Äì the core operational logic (e.g., client, worker).
- Transfers MODULE_5 as a memory buffer to MODULE_4.
- Injects MODULE_4 reflectively into a trusted system process.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This module is responsible for **initiating the long-term lifecycle** of the system.

### üß† Key Notes

- Designed for minimal disruption: launches a decoy or host application via `Mimic` class for visual consistency.
- Employs a **custom reflective injector** to load MODULE_4:
  - Built using direct system calls.
  - Avoids runtime API lookups or imports during injection.
  - Transfers **MODULE_5** as a parameter through an in-memory structure.
- Built-in sandbox detection and pause logic prevent premature execution in analysis environments.

### üîß Technologies & Concepts Used

- **C++17**
- **TLS-enabled downloader**  
  - Built from scratch using `ws2_32.dll` and `SspiCli.dll` (Schannel).
- **7z archive unpacking**  
  - Extracts modules from memory using internal decompression engine.
- **Custom syscall-based reflective injection**  
  - Performs clean, in-memory deployment with no disk writes for injected modules.
- **Memory control**  
  - Manual memory allocation and buffer relocation before injection.
- **Execution decoys**  
  - Uses customizable mimicry targets for stealth and misdirection.

> Implementation details can be discussed or demonstrated in a personal setting.

### üì¶ Deployed Components

- **MODULE_4** ‚Äì Monitors target module execution and ensures persistence during runtime.
- **MODULE_5** ‚Äì The main runtime component (e.g., data collection, task execution).  
  Both are loaded from secure external storage and executed in-memory.
