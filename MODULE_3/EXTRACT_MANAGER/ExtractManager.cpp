/*
 * This source file implements in-memory extraction of 7z archive contents using the LZMA SDK:
 * - Defines a custom memory-backed seekable input stream to support archive reading without filesystem access.
 * - Uses SzArEx interface to open and iterate over archive entries, extracting file contents into a user-provided buffer.
 * - Employs dynamic memory allocation and internal buffering for performance and compatibility.
 * - Handles CRC initialization and resource cleanup in compliance with LZMA extraction workflow.
 * - Enables seamless integration of compressed data embedded directly in memory.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
