 * This header aggregates all core components required for runtime coordination and injection logic:
 * - Ensures correct inclusion order and macro definitions for dynamic syscall resolution.
 * - Declares essential modules for environment validation, remote injection, process launching, download, and extraction.
 * - Central entry point for combining functionality across the reflective injection pipeline.
 * - Explicitly defines system call stubs and platform-specific constants through assembler headers.
