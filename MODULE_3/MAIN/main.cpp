/*
 * This source file orchestrates the full runtime lifecycle of a reflective injection framework:
 * - Resolves essential NT functions dynamically using hashed exports from NTDLL.
 * - Determines Windows version to select appropriate syscall indices.
 * - Launches a decoy application to simulate desired behavior before performing sandbox checks.
 * - Validates execution environment with behavioral and timing-based heuristics.
 * - Downloads and extracts payloads in-memory using TLS and 7z decompression routines without disk I/O.
 * - Relocates payloads into virtual memory and performs reflective DLL injection into a target process.
 * - Passes runtime parameters to the injected module and cleans up resources upon completion.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
