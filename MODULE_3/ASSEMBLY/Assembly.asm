/*
 * This assembly source defines low-level syscall stubs with dynamically resolved system call numbers:
 * - Each procedure prepares syscall-specific parameters in registers before invoking `syscall`.
 * - Syscall numbers are dynamically retrieved from the stack, allowing flexible execution across system versions.
 * - Supports operations including memory management, process/thread creation, interprocess communication, and system queries.
 * - Provides minimalistic, fixed-layout stubs for direct kernel interaction without relying on import tables.

 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
 * 109 LOC
