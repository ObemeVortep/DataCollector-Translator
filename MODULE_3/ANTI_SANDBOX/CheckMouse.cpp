/*
 * This source file implements behavioral heuristics to evaluate mouse activity for environment validation:
 * - Tracks real-time cursor movement to analyze human-like interaction patterns over time.
 * - Measures displacement variance and trajectory consistency to detect automation or synthetic input.
 * - Blocks execution until genuine mouse activity is detected, enforcing active user presence.
 * - Dynamically resolves API functions to operate independently of static library imports.
 * - Designed without C runtime dependency to support minimal or unconventional runtime contexts.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
