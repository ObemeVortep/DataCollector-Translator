/*
 * This source file implements runtime environment evaluation logic for behavioral integrity checks:
 * - Coordinates multiple detection methods to assess timing accuracy, execution delays, and user input patterns.
 * - Uses system time queries and processor instructions to identify inconsistencies in the runtime environment.
 * - Performs statistical analysis of low-level timing data to detect virtualization artifacts.
 * - Avoids reliance on the C runtime library, ensuring compatibility with minimal runtime contexts.
 * - Supports external initialization of internal function pointers for dynamic use.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
