/*
 * Declares a class for evaluating runtime characteristics to detect sandboxed or emulated environments:
 * - Provides methods for timing-based heuristics and low-level instruction analysis.
 * - Uses RDTSC and sleep-based checks to identify anomalies in instruction execution or scheduling.
 * - Analyzes mouse interaction timing to infer genuine user presence.
 * - Avoids dependency on the C runtime library for all detection methods.
 * - Supports dynamic initialization with custom LdrLoadDll and LdrUnloadDll function pointers.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
