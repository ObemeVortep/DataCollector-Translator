/*
 * This source file implements core logic for reflective DLL injection using direct memory manipulation:
 * - Locates the offset of a ReflectiveLoader export within a DLL image by scanning the export table.
 * - Converts relative virtual addresses (RVAs) to file offsets based on PE section headers.
 * - Allocates memory in the target process and writes the DLL image to it using low-level NT syscalls.
 * - Sets memory protections, resolves the loader entry point, and creates a remote thread to begin execution.
 * - Supports parameterized injection via custom structure preparation and ensures proper cleanup.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
