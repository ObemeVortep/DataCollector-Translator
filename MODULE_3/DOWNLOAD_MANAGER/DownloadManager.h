/*
 * This header defines a class-based manager for secure TLS-based file downloads using dynamically loaded APIs:
 * - Encapsulates network connection setup, data transmission, and teardown over a secure channel.
 * - Dynamically resolves and manages functions from Winsock and SSPI libraries for runtime TLS communication.
 * - Integrates custom utility logic through inheritance and uses internal resource tracking for cleanup.
 * - Supports customizable loader/unloader functions for DLL management through constructor injection.
 * - Avoids static dependencies by operating entirely through function pointers.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
