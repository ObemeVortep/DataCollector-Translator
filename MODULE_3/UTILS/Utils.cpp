/*
 * This source file implements dynamic API resolution and module lookup using hash-based identification:
 * - Calculates case-insensitive hashes for ASCII strings using a rotate-and-add scheme.
 * - Enumerates the export table of a loaded module to match and resolve function addresses by hash.
 * - Traverses the Windows PEB loader data to locate loaded modules based on hashed names.
 * - Avoids reliance on standard library functions or OS APIs, supporting use in minimal environments.
 * - Provides utility functions for constructing UNICODE_STR values and assigning function pointers.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
