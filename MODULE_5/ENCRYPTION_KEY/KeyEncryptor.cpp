/*
 * Implements logic to identify supported processes and decrypt application-specific data using COM interfaces.
 *
 * - Detects the host process by checking the image path via the PEB structure.
 * - Compares the process name against a list of known targets and iterates through stored data entries.
 * - If the target conditions are met, invokes a specific COM object to handle decryption.
 * - Dynamically resolves and loads COM-related functions from combase and oleaut32 using hashed module/function names.
 * - Allocates and passes encrypted data as a BSTR, then extracts and copies the decrypted binary into a buffer.
 * - Performs full lifecycle of COM object instantiation, method invocation, and cleanup.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
