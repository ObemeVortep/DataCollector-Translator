 * - Allocates memory for the image and copies headers and sections.
 * - Manually performs relocations based on delta from preferred base.
 * - Skips import resolution (this image is self-sufficient).
 * - Flushes instruction cache and sets section memory protections.
 * - Calls the DLL's entry point with a custom reason code.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
