 * Implements initialization and teardown logic for specific data capture and data transmission via Direct3D and GDI+.
 *
 * - Dynamically loads and resolves required APIs from gdiplus, d3d11, ole32, and other modules.
 * - Sets up GDI+ to enable JPEG encoding and image stream handling.
 * - Uses Direct3D 11 and DXGI to duplicate the specific data, extract frames, and copy them via a staging texture.
 * - Allocates and manages memory buffers for raw and processed specific data.
 * - Establishes network communication over UDP and installs inline hooks for buffered transmission.
 * - Ensures full resource cleanup for graphics, memory, and COM modules during destruction.
