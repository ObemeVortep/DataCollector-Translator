/*
 * Implements the WebManager constructor and core methods for dynamic Winsock initialization and teardown.
 *
 * - Dynamically loads Ws2_32.dll if not already present, resolving key network API function addresses.
 * - WebInit sets up Winsock and resolves address information using provided connection parameters.
 * - WebRelease cleans up allocated address info and unloads the Winsock library if applicable.
 * - All API function calls are routed through dynamically resolved pointers for stealth and flexibility.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
