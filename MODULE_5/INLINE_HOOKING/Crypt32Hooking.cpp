/*
 * Implements inline hooking for CryptUnprotectData to intercept and modify decrypted output.
 *
 * - Resolves the target function dynamically from the crypt32 module using a hashed identifier.
 * - Saves the original bytes and address, then installs a trampoline hook redirecting to a custom handler.
 * - The hooked function calls the original via trampoline and applies post-processing to the output buffer.
 * - Ensures safe hook removal by restoring original bytes and memory state.
 * - Uses a static instance pointer for access within the hooked context.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
