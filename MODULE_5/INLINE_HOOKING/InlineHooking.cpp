/*
 * Implements inline hook installation and removal by modifying executable memory at runtime.
 *
 * - Uses dynamic syscalls for memory allocation, protection, and writing.
 * - Creates a trampoline buffer containing original instructions and a jump back sequence.
 * - Replaces original function prologue with a jump to a new handler while preserving execution flow.
 * - Fills any excess bytes with NOP instructions for stability.
 * - Hook removal restores the original bytes by resetting memory protection and writing back preserved data.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
