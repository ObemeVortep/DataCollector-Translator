 *
 * - Loads and initializes core CRT functions (malloc, memcpy, etc.) from msvcrt using syscall-based memory routines.
 * - Retrieves exported function addresses from module export tables by hashing their names.
 * - Scans loaded modules in the process environment block to match DLLs by hashed name.
 * - Provides thread delay functionality via direct system time and execution pause syscalls.
 * - Includes internal hashing and string utilities used across the codebase.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
