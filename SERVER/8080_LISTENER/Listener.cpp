/*
 * This source file implements a multithreaded UDP listener that:
 * - Sets up a UDP listener on port 8080
 * - Receives fragmented input from clients
 * - Identifies and reassembles multi-part transmissions
 * - Spawns background handlers for completed sessions
 * - Writes processed output to disk using a time-based structure
 *
 * Synchronization is handled via scoped mutex locking,
 * and processing is offloaded via detached threads.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
