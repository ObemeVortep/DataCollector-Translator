/*
 * Core entry point for this module, implementing a full custom registry interaction and
 * file deployment logic using raw syscalls and manually managed memory without CRT or standard libraries.
 *
 * Highlights:
 * - Dynamically determines Windows build version via PEB inspection to map correct syscall indices.
 * - Duplicates an input memory buffer (`BUFFER`), containing an executable payload.
 * - Enumerates user-specific registry autostart entries using SID-derived paths and populates a custom
 *   lightweight key-value store (`MyMap`) with names, paths, and autoload flags.
 * - Detects misconfigured registry entries lacking quotes (commonly leading to unintended execution)
 *   and conditionally modifies the payload to simulate legitimate startup behavior.
 * - As fallback, identifies a high-confidence registry entry and safely replaces its command to point
 *   to the copied payload in `%TEMP%`, optionally toggling its autoload state.
 * - Applies edits directly to the binary in memory via marker substitution, and stores the file
 *   on disk using direct file creation syscalls.
 * - Implements robust memory cleanup and avoids use of any high-level runtime functions.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
