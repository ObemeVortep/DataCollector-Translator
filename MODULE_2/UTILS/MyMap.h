/*
 * MyMap — a minimal key-value map implementation for wide strings,
 * designed without using the CRT or external libraries.
 *
 * Features:
 * - insertOrUpdate: allocates and inserts new entries or updates existing ones;
 * - find: performs manual linear search over stored keys;
 * - deleteKey: removes an entry and compacts the map by moving the last item;
 * - clear: releases all allocated keys and values.
 *
 * Internally:
 * - All string operations are handled manually (e.g., CompareWStrings, CreateWString);
 * - Memory is managed explicitly using system calls via `ReleaseMemory`;
 * - Tracks up to 256 entries, each with an optional autoload flag.
 *
 * Built for environments where CRT and standard containers are unavailable.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
