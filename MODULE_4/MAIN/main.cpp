/*
 * This source file implements the main execution loop of the data delivery framework:
 * - Detects the Windows version and prepares a reallocated payload buffer in memory.
 * - Initializes a module responsible for extracting protected runtime data from the host.
 * - Defines a set of target processes (e.g., Chromium-based network service modules).
 * - Performs reflective injection of the payload into a suitable remote process using system calls only.
 * - Transfers prepared runtime parameters into the target process’s memory space.
 * - Waits for the injected process to terminate, then reinitializes the cycle.
 *
 * All memory allocation, process access, and injection steps are performed using native syscall wrappers,
 * bypassing the Windows API and CRT.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
