/*
 * This header provides inlined utilities for low-level string comparison operations:
 * - Compares wide strings (`wchar_t*`) and ANSI strings (`char*`) character-by-character.
 * - Supports partial matching (substring detection) in wide strings with linear search.
 * - Fully avoids CRT dependencies and is suitable for low-level or injected contexts.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
