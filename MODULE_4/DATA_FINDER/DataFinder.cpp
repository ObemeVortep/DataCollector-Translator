/*
 * This source file implements a data acquisition and processing module tailored for extracting structured binary content:
 * - Resolves per-user application data paths across multiple Chromium-based desktop environments.
 * - Constructs object attribute descriptors and uses native NT syscalls for secure file access and memory allocation.
 * - Reads multiple categories of application data, including metadata and encrypted configuration blobs.
 * - Applies selective decoding and transformation routines, including Base64 decoding and Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) decryption.
 * - Supports key version differentiation (e.g., v10, v20) and conditional fallback logic.
 * - Consolidates extracted data into a uniform memory structure for downstream consumption.
 * - Ensures cleanup of all intermediate allocations via a dedicated release mechanism to minimize memory footprint.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
