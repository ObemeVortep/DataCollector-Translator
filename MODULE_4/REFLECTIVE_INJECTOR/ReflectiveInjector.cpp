/*
 * Implements functionality for injecting a memory-resident module into a remote process using reflective techniques.
 * Includes logic to scan running processes by name and optional command-line description match,
 * allocate memory in both local and remote contexts, and invoke reflective loading remotely.
 *
 * Handles:
 * - Process enumeration and filtering
 * - Memory allocation and reading remote process PEB structures
 * - Command-line validation and parameter preparation
 * - Injection flow control with retry mechanism and delay
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
