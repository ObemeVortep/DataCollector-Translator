/*
 * Implements remote memory allocation and structured parameter preparation for reflective module execution:
 *
 * - Constructs a parameter block in remote memory to be passed into a loaded module.
 * - Dynamically builds syscall stubs (NtAllocateVirtualMemory, NtProtectVirtualMemory, NtFlushInstructionCache)
 *   and writes them to the remote process with correct syscall indices per Windows version.
 * - Serializes structured data including buffers and encryption keys into a layout suitable for cross-process use.
 * - Performs correct memory alignment to ensure reliable execution and structure validity.
 * - Handles cleanup of allocated memory regions to maintain stability and avoid leaks.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
