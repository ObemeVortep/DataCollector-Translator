/*
 * Defines logic for remotely loading a memory-resident module into another process using reflective offset resolution.
 * Implements functionality to:
 * - Locate a target function within a PE export table
 * - Convert relative virtual addresses (RVA) to file offsets using PE header parsing
 * - Allocate memory and copy the image into the remote process address space
 * - Adjust memory protections for executable sections
 * - Launch a new thread in the remote process at the resolved entry point with custom runtime parameters
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
