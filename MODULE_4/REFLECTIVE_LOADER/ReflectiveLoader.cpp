/*
 * Implements a self-contained reflective DLL loader:
 * - Locates its own PE header by scanning backwards from return address.
 * - Allocates memory and reconstructs a PE image manually including headers and sections.
 * - Skips import processing by design.
 * - Applies base relocations to account for dynamic memory allocation.
 * - Flushes instruction cache and restores proper section memory protections.
 * - Invokes the DLL entry point with parameters passed via injection context.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
