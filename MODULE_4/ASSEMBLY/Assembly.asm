/*
 * This assembly source file defines a set of system call stubs for direct syscall invocation
 * on Windows x64 systems. Each stub maps to a low-level Windows Native API function and allows 
 * runtime execution without relying on standard imports or user-mode API resolution.
 *
 * - Implements dynamic syscall number loading via stack-relative addressing ([rsp + offset]).
 * - Avoids detection by security solutions by bypassing user-mode hooks.
 * - Enables stealthy use of core NT functions (e.g., memory allocation, process/thread creation).
 * - Can adapt to multiple OS builds if syscall numbers are resolved at runtime.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
