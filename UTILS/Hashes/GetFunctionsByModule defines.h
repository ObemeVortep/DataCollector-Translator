 * This header defines precomputed hash constants for dynamic API resolution:
 * - Includes hash values for commonly used system libraries (e.g., ntdll, kernel32, user32).
 * - Maps function names to hashes for syscall and API lookup at runtime.
 * - Supports modules related to graphics, networking, security, and system internals.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
