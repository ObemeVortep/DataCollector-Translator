/*
 * This source file implements a custom dynamic API resolver using hash-based lookup:
 * - Defines a rotation-based hash function for consistent function/module name hashing.
 * - Locates loaded modules in the current process via PEB and LDR structures.
 * - Matches modules by precomputed hash values to retrieve their base addresses.
 * - Parses export tables manually to resolve function addresses by hashed names.
 * - Avoids standard Windows API functions to minimize detection and dependencies.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
