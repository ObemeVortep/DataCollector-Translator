 * This header defines structured containers for use in modular runtime operations:
 * - Provides a struct for passing essential memory and execution-related function pointers.
 * - Includes optional data buffer definitions for handling memory blocks in specific build configurations.
 * - Supports structured grouping of runtime data associated with multiple sources.
 * - Designed for clean inter-component data exchange without dependency on external libraries.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
