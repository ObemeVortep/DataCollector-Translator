 * This header defines types and function pointers used for secure in-memory file retrieval over network sockets:
 * - Implements a TLS-capable socket structure supporting encrypted data streams.
 * - Declares dynamic function pointers for core networking and security APIs from WinSock and SSPI libraries.
 * - Supports runtime loading of system libraries to perform secure communication without static linking.
 * - Enables flexible data handling and modular usage in custom environments.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
