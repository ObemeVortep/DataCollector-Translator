/*
 * This assembly module implements syscall stubs for dynamic invocation of NT system functions:
 * - Provides lightweight wrappers that load syscall numbers from runtime stack offsets or registers.
 * - Enables flexible dispatching of system calls without reliance on static import tables.
 * - Designed for use in contexts requiring direct, low-level interaction with the Windows kernel.
 * - Supports dynamic number resolution for version compatibility.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
