/*
 * This source file implements runtime environment evaluation logic for behavioral integrity checks:
 * - Coordinates multiple detection methods to assess timing accuracy, execution delays, and user input patterns.
 * - Uses system time queries and processor instructions to identify inconsistencies in the runtime environment.
 * - Employs lightweight logic to minimize dependency on external libraries or APIs.
 * - Supports modular initialization with externally provided function pointers.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
