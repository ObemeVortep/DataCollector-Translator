/*
 * This source file implements user interaction analysis through cursor movement tracking:
 * - Dynamically resolves input APIs to capture real-time mouse position data.
 * - Waits for detectable activity before sampling motion over a timed interval.
 * - Analyzes movement to evaluate natural variability and deviation patterns.
 * - Aims to distinguish between genuine input behavior and programmatic simulation.
